I'm a computer science student and software developer.

Currently working on interesting multiplayer scalability solutions with [Rain Framework](https://github.com/RainFramework).

I also own and operate [Strive Services LLC](https://github.com/StriveServicesLLC), which has provided fun multiplayer experiences to over **100,000** unique users since April 2020.
